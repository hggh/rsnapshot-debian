These are the necessary files to build an RPM file.

"make rpm" will do this all for you if your system is set up just right.

Copy the source code tarball to your SOURCES directory.
Copy SOURCES/rsnapshot.patch to your SOURCES directory.
Copy SPECS/rsnapshot.spec to your SPECS directory.

rpmbuild -bb /path/to/your/SPECS/rsnapshot.spec
rpm -ivh /path/to/your/RPMS/noarch/rsnapshot-1.x.x-0.noarch.rpm

If you don't want to make an RPM, you can download the latest version at
