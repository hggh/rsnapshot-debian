rsnapshot TODO list:

Future versions (in no particular order)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add "print-config" command.  (Added: djk 2006-09-24)

- Converge rpm packages/spec files between rsnapshot, fedora, suse.
  (Added: djk 2006-09-24)

- Go through old TODO list.  (Added: djk 2006-09-24)


Old TODO list -- from 1.2.x (2005) and earlier
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add visible return values for error messages on commands like rm, cp, etc

- Add global and per-backup "bwlimit" parameter, and pass it along to rsync

- Revamp config file to allow better representation of hierarchial data

- Add "delete" feature, to allow deleting specific directories or files
  from the snapshot_root without having to get your hands dirty. This code
  will be extremely well tested and fault tolerant.

- Tighten up validation of third argument on backup points

- Add e-mail reporting patch from David Tejedor.

- Look into using IPC to make backup calls asynchronous (with a configurable
  limit on the upper number of simultaneous backups, and auto-limiting to
  one backup job per remote or local host at once).

- Add interactive mode to generate config files.

- Add rsync STDOUT/STDERR output to logfile at higher log settings. This will
  be accomplished by opening the rsync command as a pipe to a filehandle and
  printing / logging the output.

- Think of a way to be able to backup different backup points at different
  speeds. I.E. some things would get backed up hourly, whereas other backup
  points would get backed up daily.
