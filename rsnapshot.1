.IX Title "rsnapshot 1"
.TH rsnapshot 1 "2006-10-21" "" ""
.SH "NAME"
rsnapshot \- remote filesystem snapshot utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBrsnapshot\fR [\fB\-vtxqVD\fR] [\fB\-c\fR cfgfile] [command] [args]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBrsnapshot\fR is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental
snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.
.PP
Local filesystem snapshots are handled with \fB\f(BIrsync\fB\|(1)\fR. Secure remote
connections are handled with rsync over \fB\f(BIssh\fB\|(1)\fR, while anonymous
rsync connections simply use an rsync server. Both remote and local
transfers depend on rsync.
.PP
\&\fBrsnapshot\fR saves much more disk space than you might imagine. The amount
of space required is roughly the size of one full backup, plus a copy
of each additional file that is changed. \fBrsnapshot\fR makes extensive
use of hard links, so if the file doesn't change, the next snapshot is
simply a hard link to the exact same file.
.PP
\&\fBrsnapshot\fR will typically be invoked as root by a cron job, or series
of cron jobs. It is possible, however, to run as any arbitrary user
with an alternate configuration file.
.PP
All important options are specified in a configuration file, which is
located by default at \fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR. An alternate file can be
specified on the command line. There are also additional options which
can be passed on the command line.
.PP
The command line options are as follows:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fB\-v\fR verbose, show shell commands being executed
.Sp
\&\fB\-t\fR test, show shell commands that would be executed
.Sp
\&\fB\-c\fR path to alternate config file
.Sp
\&\fB\-x\fR one filesystem, don't cross partitions within each backup point
.Sp
\&\fB\-q\fR quiet, suppress non-fatal warnings
.Sp
\&\fB\-V\fR same as \-v, but with more detail
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR a firehose of diagnostic information
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
\&\fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR is the default configuration file. All parameters
in this file must be separated by tabs. \fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default\fR
can be used as a reference.
.PP
It is recommended that you copy \fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default\fR to
\&\fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR, and then modify \fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR to suit
your needs.
.PP
Here is a list of allowed parameters:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fBconfig_version\fR     Config file version (required). Default is 1.2
.Sp
\&\fBsnapshot_root\fR      Local filesystem path to save all snapshots
.Sp
\&\fBinclude_conf\fR       Include another file in the configuration at this point.
.Sp
.RS 4
This is recursive, but you may need to be careful about paths when specifying
which file to include.  We check to see if the file you have specified is
readable, and will yell an error if it isn't.  We recommend using a full
path.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBno_create_root\fR     If set to 1, rsnapshot won't create snapshot_root directory
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_rsync\fR          Full path to rsync (required)
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_ssh\fR            Full path to ssh (optional)
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_cp\fR             Full path to cp  (optional, but must be \s-1GNU\s0 version)
.Sp
.RS 4
If you are using Linux, you should uncomment cmd_cp. If you are using a
platform which does not have \s-1GNU\s0 cp, you should leave cmd_cp commented out.
.Sp
With \s-1GNU\s0 cp, rsnapshot can take care of both normal files and special
files (such as FIFOs, sockets, and block/character devices) in one pass.
.Sp
If cmd_cp is disabled, rsnapshot will use its own built-in function,
\&\fInative_cp_al()\fR to backup up regular files and directories. This will
then be followed up by a separate call to rsync, to move the special
files over (assuming there are any).
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_rm\fR             Full path to rm (optional)
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_logger\fR         Full path to logger (optional, for syslog support)
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_du\fR             Full path to du (optional, for disk usage reports)
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_rsnapshot_diff\fR Full path to rsnapshot-diff (optional)
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_preexec\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Full path (plus any arguments) to preexec script (optional).
This script will run immediately before each backup operation (but not any
rotations).
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBcmd_postexec\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Full path (plus any arguments) to postexec script (optional).
This script will run immediately after each backup operation (but not any
rotations).
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBinterval\fR           [name]   [number]
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\*(L"name\*(R" refers to the name of this interval (e.g., hourly, daily). \*(L"number\*(R"
is the number of snapshots for this type of interval that will be stored.
The value of \*(L"name\*(R" will be the command passed to \fBrsnapshot\fR to perform
this type of backup.
.Sp
Example: \fBinterval hourly 6\fR
.Sp
[root@localhost]# \fBrsnapshot hourly\fR
.Sp
For this example, every time this is run, the following will happen:
.Sp
<snapshot_root>/hourly.5/ will be deleted, if it exists.
.Sp
<snapshot_root>/hourly.{1,2,3,4} will all be rotated +1, if they exist.
.Sp
<snapshot_root>/hourly.0/ will be copied to <snapshot_root>/hourly.1/
using hard links.
.Sp
Each backup point (explained below) will then be rsynced to the
corresponding directories in <snapshot_root>/hourly.0/
.Sp
Intervals must be specified in the config file in order, from most
frequent to least frequent. The first entry is the one which will be
synced with the backup points. The subsequent intervals (e.g., daily,
weekly, etc) simply rotate, with each higher interval pulling from the
one below it for its .0 directory.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fBinterval  hourly 6\fR
.Sp
\&\fBinterval  daily  7\fR
.Sp
\&\fBinterval  weekly 4\fR
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
daily.0/ will be copied from hourly.5/, and weekly.0/ will be copied from daily.6/
.Sp
hourly.0/ will be rsynced directly from the filesystem.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBlink_dest           1\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
If your version of rsync supports \-\-link\-dest (2.5.7 or newer), you can enable
this to let rsync handle some things that \s-1GNU\s0 cp or the built-in subroutines would
otherwise do. Enabling this makes rsnapshot take a slightly more complicated code
branch, but it's the best way to support special files on non-Linux systems.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBsync_first          1\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
sync_first changes the behaviour of rsnapshot. When this is enabled, all calls
to rsnapshot with various intervals simply rotate files. All backups are handled
by calling rsnapshot with the \*(L"sync\*(R" argument. The synced files are stored in
a \*(L".sync\*(R" directory under the snapshot_root.
.Sp
This allows better recovery in the event that rsnapshot is interrupted in the
middle of a sync operation, since the sync step and rotation steps are
seperated. This also means that you can easily run \*(L"rsnapshot sync\*(R" on the
command line without fear of forcing all the other directories to rotate up.
This benefit comes at the cost of one more snapshot worth of disk space.
The default is 0 (off).
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBverbose             2\fR

\&\fBloglevel            3\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
This number means the same thing as \fBverbose\fR above, but it determines how
much data is written to the logfile, if one is being written.
.Sp
The only thing missing from this at the higher levels is the direct output
from rsync. We hope to add support for this in a future release.

List of short arguments to pass to rsync. If not specified,

\&\fBrsync_long_args     \-\-delete \-\-numeric\-ids \-\-relative \-\-delete\-excluded\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
List of long arguments to pass to rsync. Beginning with rsnapshot 1.2.0, this
default has changed. In previous versions, the default values were
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    --delete --numeric-ids
.Ve
.Sp
Starting with version 1.2.0, the default values are
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    --delete --numeric-ids --relative --delete-excluded
.Ve
.Sp
This directly affects how the destination paths in your backup points are
constructed. Depending on what behaviour you want, you can explicitly set
the values to make the program behave like the old version or the current
version. The newer settings are recommended if you're just starting. If
you are upgrading, read the upgrade guide in the \s-1INSTALL\s0 file in the
source distribution for more information.
.Sp
Quotes are permitted in rsync_long_args, eg \-\-rsync\-path=\*(L"sudo /usr/bin/rsync\*(R".
You may use either single (') or double (") quotes, but nested quotes (including
mixed nested quotes) are not permitted.  Similar quoting is also allowed in
per-backup-point rsync_long_args.

Arguments to be passed to du. If not specified, the default is \-csh.
\&\s-1GNU\s0 du supports \-csh, \s-1BSD\s0 du supports \-csk, Solaris du doesn't support
\&\-c at all. The \s-1GNU\s0 version is recommended, since it offers the most
features.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBlockfile    /var/run/rsnapshot.pid\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Lockfile to use when rsnapshot is run. This prevents a second invocation
from clobbering the first one. If not specified, no lock file is used.
Make sure to use a directory that is not world writeable for security
reasons.  Use of a lock file is strongly recommended.
.Sp
If a lockfile exists when rsnapshot starts, it will try to read the file
and stop with an error if it can't.  If it *can* read the file, it sees if
a process exists with the \s-1PID\s0 noted in the file.  If it does, rsnapshot
stops with an error message.  If there is no process with that \s-1PID\s0, then
we assume that the lockfile is stale and ignore it.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBone_fs    1\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Prevents rsync from crossing filesystem partitions. Setting this to a value

The default is 0 (off).
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBuse_lazy_deletes    1\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
Changes default behavior of rsnapshot and does not initially remove the 
oldest snapshot. Instead it moves that directory to \*(L"interval\*(R".delete, and 
continues as normal. Once the backup has been completed, the lockfile will
be removed before rsnapshot starts deleting the directory.
.Sp
Enabling this means that snapshots get taken sooner (since the delete doesn't
come first), and any other rsnapshot processes are allowed to start while the
final delete is happening. This benefit comes at the cost of one more
snapshot worth of disk space. The default is 0 (off).

using an anonymous rsync server. Please note that unlike backing up local paths
and using rsync over ssh, rsync servers have \*(L"modules\*(R", which are top level
directories that are exported. Therefore, the module should also be specified in
the destination path, as shown in the example above (the pub/ directory at the
end).

\&\fBbackup   /var/     localhost/   one_fs=1\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
This is the same as the other examples, but notice how the fourth parameter
is passed. This sets this backup point to not span filesystem partitions.
If the global one_fs has been set, this will override it locally.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBbackup_script      /usr/local/bin/backup_database.sh   db_backup/\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
In this example, we specify a script or program to run. This script should simply
create files and/or directories in its current working directory. rsnapshot will
then take that output and move it into the directory specified in the third column.
.Sp
Please note that whatever is in the destination directory will be completely
deleted and recreated. For this reason, rsnapshot prevents you from specifying
a destination directory for a backup_script that will clobber other backups.
.Sp
So in this example, say the backup_database.sh script simply runs a command like:
.Sp
.RS 4
#!/bin/sh
.Sp
mysqldump \-uusername mydatabase > mydatabase.sql
.Sp
chmod u=r,go= mydatabase.sql	# r\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- (0400)
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
rsnapshot will take the generated \*(L"mydatabase.sql\*(R" file and move it into the
<snapshot_root>/<interval>.0/db_backup/ directory. On subsequent runs,
rsnapshot checks the differences between the files created against the
previous files. If the backup script generates the same output on the next
run, the files will be hard linked against the previous ones, and no
additional disk space will be taken up.

\&\fBrsnapshot\fR can be used by any user, but for system-wide backups
you will probably want to run it as root.
.Sp
Since backups usually get neglected if human intervention is
required, the preferred way is to run it from cron.
.Sp
When you are first setting up your backups, you will probably
also want to run it from the command line once or twice to get
a feel for what it's doing.
.Sp
Here is an example crontab entry, assuming that intervals \fBhourly\fR,
\&\fBdaily\fR, \fBweekly\fR and \fBmonthly\fR have been defined in \fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fB0 */4 * * *         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly\fR
.Sp
\&\fB50 23 * * *         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily\fR
.Sp
\&\fB40 23 * * 6         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot weekly\fR
.Sp
\&\fB30 23 1 * *         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot monthly\fR
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This example will do the following:
.Sp
.RS 4
6 hourly backups a day (once every 4 hours, at 0,4,8,12,16,20)
.Sp
1 daily backup every day, at 11:50PM
.Sp
1 weekly backup every week, at 11:40PM, on Saturdays (6th day of week)
.Sp
1 monthly backup every month, at 11:30PM on the 1st day of the month
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is usually a good idea to schedule the larger intervals to run a bit before the
lower ones. For example, in the crontab above, notice that \*(L"daily\*(R" runs 10 minutes
before \*(L"hourly\*(R".  The main reason for this is that the daily rotate will
pull out the oldest hourly and make that the youngest daily (which means
that the next hourly rotate will not need to delete the oldest hourly),
which is more efficient.  A secondary reason is that it is harder to
predict how long the lowest interval will take, since it needs to actually
do an rsync of the source as well as the rotate that all intervals do.
.Sp
If rsnapshot takes longer than 10 minutes to do the \*(L"daily\*(R" rotate
(which usually includes deleting the oldest daily snapshot), then you
should increase the time between the intervals.
Otherwise (assuming you have set the \fBlockfile\fR parameter, as is recommended)
your hourly snapshot will fail sometimes because the daily still has the lock.  
.Sp
Remember that these are just the times that the program runs.
To set the number of backups stored, set the \fBinterval\fR numbers in
\&\fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR
.Sp
To check the disk space used by rsnapshot, you can call it with the \*(L"du\*(R" argument.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fBrsnapshot du\fR
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This will show you exactly how much disk space is taken up in the snapshot root. This
feature requires the \s-1UNIX\s0 \fBdu\fR command to be installed on your system, for it to
support the \*(L"\-csh\*(R" command line arguments, and to be in your path. You can also
override your path settings and the flags passed to du using the cmd_du and du_args
parameters.
.Sp
It is also possible to pass a relative file path as a second argument, to get a report
on a particular file or subdirectory.
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fBrsnapshot du localhost/home/\fR
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The \s-1GNU\s0 version of \*(L"du\*(R" is preferred. The \s-1BSD\s0 version works well also, but does
not support the \-h flag (use \-k instead, to see the totals in kilobytes). Other
versions of \*(L"du\*(R", such as Solaris, may not work at all.
.Sp
To check the differences between two directories, call rsnapshot with the \*(L"diff\*(R"
argument, followed by two intervals or directory paths.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fBrsnapshot diff daily.0 daily.1\fR
.Sp
\&\fBrsnapshot diff daily.0/localhost/etc daily.1/localhost/etc\fR
.Sp
\&\fBrsnapshot diff /.snapshots/daily.0 /.snapshots/daily.1\fR
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This will call the rsnapshot-diff program, which will scan both directories
looking for differences (based on hard links).
.Sp
\&\fBrsnapshot sync\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
When \fBsync_first\fR is enabled, rsnapshot must first be called with the \fBsync\fR
argument, followed by the other usual cron entries. The sync should happen as
the lowest, most frequent interval, and right before. For example:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fB0 */4 * * *         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot sync && /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly\fR
.Sp
\&\fB50 23 * * *         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily\fR
.Sp
\&\fB40 23 1,8,15,22 * * /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot weekly\fR
.Sp
\&\fB30 23 1 * *         /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot monthly\fR
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The sync operation simply runs rsync and all backup scripts. In this scenario, all
interval calls simply rotate directories, even the lowest interval.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
\&\fBrsnapshot sync [dest]\fR
.Sp
.RS 4
When \fBsync_first\fR is enabled, all sync behaviour happens during an additional
sync step (see above). When using the sync argument, it is also possible to specify
a backup point destination as an optional parameter. If this is done, only backup
points sharing that destination path will be synced.
.Sp
For example, let's say that example.com is a destination path shared by one or more
of your backup points.
.Sp
.RS 4
rsnapshot sync example.com
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This command will only sync the files that normally get backed up into example.com.
It will \s-1NOT\s0 get any other backup points with slightly different values (like
example.com/etc/, for example). In order to sync example.com/etc, you would need to
run rsnapshot again, using example.com/etc as the optional parameter.

Make sure your /etc/rsnapshot.conf file has all elements separated by tabs.
See /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default for a working example file.
.Sp
Make sure you put a trailing slash on the end of all directory references.
If you don't, you may have extra directories created in your snapshots.
For more information on how the trailing slash is handled, see the
\&\fB\f(BIrsync\fB\|(1)\fR manpage.
.Sp
Make sure to make the snapshot directory chmod 700 and owned by root
(assuming backups are made by the root user). If the snapshot directory
is readable by other users, they will be able to modify the snapshots
containing their files, thus destroying the integrity of the snapshots.
.Sp
If you would like regular users to be able to restore their own backups,
there are a number of ways this can be accomplished. One such scenario
would be:
.Sp
Set \fBsnapshot_root\fR to \fB/.private/.snapshots\fR in \fB/etc/rsnapshot.conf\fR
.Sp
Set the file permissions on these directories as follows:
.Sp
.RS 4
drwx\-\-\-\-\-\-    /.private
.Sp
drwxr-xr-x    /.private/.snapshots
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Export the /.private/.snapshots directory over read-only \s-1NFS\s0, a read-only
Samba share, etc.
.Sp
See the rsnapshot \s-1HOWTO\s0 for more information on making backups
accessible to non-privileged users.
.Sp
For ssh to work unattended through cron, you will probably want to use
public key logins. Create an ssh key with no passphrase for root, and
install the public key on each machine you want to backup. If you are
backing up system files from remote machines, this probably means
unattended root logins. Another possibility is to create a second user
on the machine just for backups. Give the user a different name such
as \*(L"rsnapshot\*(R", but keep the \s-1UID\s0 and \s-1GID\s0 set to 0, to give root
privileges. However, make logins more restrictive, either through ssh
configuration, or using an alternate shell.
.Sp
\&\s-1BE\s0 \s-1CAREFUL\s0! If the private key is obtained by an attacker, they will
have free run of all the systems involved. If you are unclear on how
to do this, see \fB\f(BIssh\fB\|(1)\fR, \fB\f(BIsshd\fB\|(1)\fR, and \fB\f(BIssh\-keygen\fB\|(1)\fR.
.Sp
Backup scripts are run as the same user that rsnapshot is running as.
Typically this is root. Make sure that all of your backup scripts are
only writable by root, and that they don't call any other programs
that aren't owned by root. If you fail to do this, anyone who can
write to the backup script or any program it calls can fully take
over the machine. Of course, this is not a situation unique to
rsnapshot.
.Sp
By default, rsync transfers are done using the \-\-numeric\-ids option.
This means that user names and group names are ignored during transfers,
but the \s-1UID/GID\s0 information is kept intact. The assumption is that the
backups will be restored in the same environment they came from. Without
this option, restoring backups for multiple heterogeneous servers would
be unmanageable. If you are archiving snapshots with \s-1GNU\s0 tar, you may
want to use the \-\-numeric\-owner parameter. Also, keep a copy of the
archived system's /etc/passwd and /etc/group files handy for the \s-1UID/GID\s0
to name mapping.
.Sp
If you remove backup points in the config file, the previously archived
files under those points will permanently stay in the snapshots directory
unless you remove the files yourself. If you want to conserve disk space,
you will need to go into the <snapshot_root> directory and manually
remove the files from the smallest interval's \*(L".0\*(R" directory.
.Sp
For example, if you were previously backing up /home/ with a destination
of localhost/, and hourly is your smallest interval, you would need to do
the following to reclaim that disk space:
.Sp
.RS 4
rm \-rf <snapshot_root>/hourly.0/localhost/home/
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Please note that the other snapshots previously made of /home/ will still
be using that disk space, but since the files are flushed out of hourly.0/,
they will no longer be copied to the subsequent directories, and will thus
be removed in due time as the rotations happen.
